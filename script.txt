MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.04}
Hi! You’ve both been asked to participate in a peer mediation. It’s meant to help you, and you’re not in trouble. I’ll explain more in a bit. Please follow me.

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Okay. 

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Okay. 

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.4 tempo=1.04}
Hello! My name is Emily and this is Michael. What are your names?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
I’m Caleb.

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
I’m Aria.

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=0.98}
This is peer mediation, where students talk things through and solve conflicts without adults.

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=0.98}
As peer mediators, we won’t share anything you say here with other students.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
It sounds like you had a disagreement, and we’re here to help you work through it.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
We’ll listen to both of your sides. We won’t take sides, but we’ll help you agree on a solution.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Most students prefer talking it out here, rather than going to the office. Want to try it out?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Yeah.

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Sure.

### E: EXPLAIN THE RULES

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
So for us to have a good mediation, there are some rules we all need to follow.

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=0.98}
The first rule is the confidentiality rule, and that's for us mediators. We won’t share what you say with other students.

[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
A rule for you both is the One Mic rule. If the other person is speaking, wait for them to finish.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
The Respect rule says that all of us need to respect each other. Do you both agree to the rules?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Yeah that's okay.

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Yeah.

### A: ASK BOTH SIDES TO SHARE

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Okay. We heard that you argued over your seats in the classroom, and both refused to move. Caleb, can you share first about what happened?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
In music, I sat down, and Aria started saying stuff about me. Like, a mean name. I didn’t want to move after that.

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=0.98}
So what I’m hearing is you sat down in music class, Aria said a mean name toward you, and you didn't want to move. Did I get that right?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=sad intensity=0.8 tempo=0.98}
Yeah, that’s right. 
[PAUSE]

[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
Aria, could you please share what happened, from your point of view?

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Yeah, that seat is where I usually sit with my friends. Caleb took it, and I asked him to move, and he wouldn’t, so I got mad.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
So you’re saying that’s your usual spot near your friends, Caleb sat there, you asked him to switch, and when he didn’t, you felt mad. Is that accurate?

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Yeah.
[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=0.98}
Caleb, how did you feel when Aria called you the mean name?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=sad intensity=1.0 tempo=0.96}
Umm... embarrassed. People were looking. It felt bad. 
[PAUSE]

[OVERLAY3]
[ProcessFormSwap]
[PAUSE]
[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
And Aria, how did you feel when you saw Caleb sitting in the seat you usually use?

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
I felt frustrated. My friends were already there. 
[PAUSE]

[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Caleb, what bothered you the most in this situation?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Being called a mean name in front of everyone. That was the worst part.
[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=0.98}
What do you want to be different between you two after today?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
I want her to not call me names or say mean stuff.
[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=0.98}
It sounds like what you want is to not be insulted in front of your classmates. Is that right?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.2 tempo=1.0}
Yeah.
[PAUSE]

[OVERLAY5]
[ProcessFormSwap]
[PAUSE]
[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
Aria, what bothered you the most in this situation?

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Not being able to sit with my friends like I usually do.
[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
What do you want to be different between you two after today?

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
I want to sit next to my friends during music without it turning into a fight.
[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
So it sounds like you want to keep your usual seat near your friends, without arguing. Is that right?

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.1 tempo=1.02}
Yeah that's right.
[PAUSE]

### C: CREATE A WIN-WIN SOLUTION

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Okay, we started this mediation because we heard that you argued over your seats and both refused to move.

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Our goal now is to work together to find a solution so that this conflict doesn’t happen again.

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
We’re going to create a win-win solution, which means you both will get something you want.
[PAUSE]
[ProcessFormSwap]
[PAUSE]
[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
Caleb, it seems like you want not to be insulted in front of your classmates.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
Aria, it seems like you want to sit next to your friends during music.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
What are some ways you can both get something you want?
[PAUSE]

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Umm... He could let me have that seat near my friends.

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Yeah, I want her to not say mean things about me.

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=0.98}
Okay, and what could help prevent future arguments?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Maybe we could just sit on different sides, so we don't bother each other again.

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.1 tempo=1.04}
I’m fine with that if I can still sit on the side with my friends.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
So a realistic thing Caleb could get is that Aria wouldn't insult him. And a realistic thing Aria could get is getting to sit next to her friends during music... Does that match what you both want?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.1 tempo=1.02}
Yeah.

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.1 tempo=1.02}
Yes.

### E: ESTABLISH AN AGREEMENT


MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
Okay, while Michael writes down the agreement, how do you feel after going through this mediation?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.1 tempo=1.0}
Better. I don't want to fight so that's good.

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.1 tempo=1.02}
Yeah, it's good, I feel better.

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=0.98}
Is there anything else you want to say to the other person?

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
I won’t say mean stuff anymore. I just want to sit with my group.

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.0}
That's okay. I’ll let you have that seat.
[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
Okay, I’m going to read the agreement out loud.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
Caleb agrees to always let Aria sit in the seat next to her friends in music class.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
Aria agrees to not say mean things about Caleb or to insult him.

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
And Both Caleb and Aria agree to sit on opposite sides of the classroom in music class so they don't fight in the future.
[PAUSE]

MEDIATOR B (MICHAEL NELSON)
{emotion=normal intensity=1.0 tempo=1.1}
Do you both agree to this?

DISPUTANT 1 (CALEB WARD)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.2 tempo=1.04}
Yeah I agree.

DISPUTANT 2 (ARIA LOPEZ)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.1 tempo=1.04}
I agree.

MEDIATOR A (EMILY JOHNSON)
{emotion=happy intensity=0.3 tempo=1.04}
